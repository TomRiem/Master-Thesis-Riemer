\chapter{Preliminaries}

Before we can discuss variants of the BFGS method, and quasi-Newton methods in general, we introduce certain basic principles and aspects, which will be needed later, in this section. The theoretical concepts have been taken from \cite{BerkolaikoKuchment:2013} where they are discussed in more detail and more background information can be found.
