\chapter{Preliminaries}


In this chapter, various preliminaries are introduced and mathematical foundations are established which are needed for the consideration of physics informed neural networks on metric graphs. First, we introduce metric graphs and their properties. Then we define on such a metric graph a set of differential equations, called drift-diffusion equations, which model traffic flow on a compact road network under certain initial and boundary conditions presented in this section. Then we introduce neural networks with their properties and their relevance as function approximators. At the end of this chapter we discuss physics informed neural networks, which provide a method for approximating the solution of various (partial) differential equations and are currently a hot topic in applied mathematics.
