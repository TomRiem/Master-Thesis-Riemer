\section{Metric Graphs}
\label{ch1:sec1}

This section is dedicated to the introduction of the basic principles about metric graphs and resulting concepts, which we need for a reasonable derivation of numerical methods on these structures. The following material has been adopted from \cite[chapter~1]{BerkolaikoKuchment:2013} unless otherwise noted. \\

We define a graph $\Gamma$ as an ordered pair $(\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$, where $\mathcal{V}$ is a finite set of points, which we call vertices, and $\mathcal{E}$ is a set of segments connecting some of the vertices, which we call edges. In the following we will use the notation $E \coloneqq \left\lvert \mathcal{E} \right\rvert$ for the number of edges and $V \coloneqq \left\lvert \mathcal{V} \right\rvert$ for the number of vertices. \\
Each edge $e \in \mathcal{E}$ can be identified with a pair $(v, w)$ of vertices $v, w \in \mathcal{V}$, which are connected by $e$. An edge $e \in \mathcal{E}$ is called a directed edge if a direction is assigned to it, for example the flux along this edge $e = (v, w)$ moves only from $v$ to $w$. In this case, the order of the pair of vertices $(v, w)$ is important. Directed edges are also called bonds, which is why we denote the set of all directed edges of a graph by $\mathcal{B}$, directed edges with $b \in \mathcal{B}$ and the number of directed edges with $B \coloneqq \left\lvert \mathcal{B} \right\rvert$. The set of bonds $\mathcal{B}$ can be uniquely described as a set of ordered pairs of vertices $\mathcal{B} = \{b_i\}_{i = 1, \ldots, B} = \{(v^{\operatorname{o}}_{i}, v^{\operatorname{t}}_{i})\}_{i = 1, \ldots, B}$, where the first vertex $v^{\operatorname{o}}_{i}$ is called the origin vertex and the second vertex $v^{\operatorname{t}}_{i}$ is called the terminal vertex of the corresponding bond $b_i$. These origin and terminal vertices of a bond can be specified via maps $o \colon \mathcal{B} \to \mathcal{V}$ and $t \colon \mathcal{B} \to \mathcal{V}$, i.e. a bond $b = (v^{\operatorname{o}}, v^{\operatorname{t}})$ begins at $\operatorname{o}(b) = v^{\operatorname{o}}$ and ends at $\operatorname{t}(b) = v^{\operatorname{t}}$. We define the set of incoming bonds at a vertex $v$ as the set of bonds satisfying $\operatorname{t}(b) = v$, if $\operatorname{o}(b) = v$, the bond $b$ is called outgoing at the vertex $v$. \\
If all edges of a graph $\Gamma = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ are bonds, i.e. $\mathcal{E} = \mathcal{B}$, we call this graph $\Gamma$ a directed graph. A graph $\Gamma = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ is called non-directed if it does not have any bonds, which means that each of its edges $e \in \mathcal{E}$ can be followed in both directions. In this case, the order of the two connected vertices describing a non-directed edge is not important, i.e. $e = (v, w) = (w, v)$ with $v, w \in \mathcal{V}$. \\
In general, graphs are represented as $1$-dimensional drawings of points and lines, where the points represent the vertices and the lines represent the edges. \cref{fig1:f1} shows an non-directed graph. In a directed graph, an arrow at the end of a line indicates which direction is assigned to the corresponding edge, as shown in \cref{fig1:f2}.

It is necessary for some considerations that a non-directed graph $\Gamma = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ will be considered as a directed graph by assigning two bonds $b$ and $\overline{b}$ with opposite directions to each edge $e \in \mathcal{E}$ of the non-directed graph $\Gamma$, as shown in \cref{fig2}. We denote the resulting directed graph by $\widetilde{\Gamma} = (\mathcal{V}, \widetilde{\mathcal{E}})$. A graph can also contain both directed and non-directed edges, i.e. $\mathcal{B} \subsetneq \mathcal{E}$. But this case is not of interest for this work and furthermore, as just explained, all non-directed edges can be assigned two bonds and thus such a graph can be considered as directed.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Obtaining a directed graph $\widetilde{\Gamma}$ by duplicating the edges of the non-directed graph $\Gamma$.}
    \label{fig2}
\end{figure}

The graph $\widetilde{\Gamma} = (\mathcal{V}, \widetilde{\mathcal{E}})$ with $\widetilde{\mathcal{E}} = \mathcal{B}$ satisfies the condition that at each vertex $v \in \mathcal{V}$ the numbers of incoming and outgoing bonds are equal, i.e. $\left\lvert \{ b \in \mathcal{B} \, \colon \, \operatorname{o}(b) = v \} \right\rvert = \left\lvert \{ b \in \mathcal{B} \, \colon \, \operatorname{t}(b) = v \} \right\rvert$. The set of bonds $\mathcal{B}$ is symmetric in the sense that $b \in \mathcal{B}$ if and only if there is another bond $\overline{b} \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $\operatorname{o}(b) = \operatorname{t}(\overline{b})$ and $\operatorname{t}(b) = \operatorname{o}(\overline{b})$ holds. The bond $\overline{b}$ is called the reversal of $b$. The operation of reversal is reflexive, i.e. $\overline{\overline{b}} = b$. \\
On a graph $\Gamma = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ a vertex $w \in \mathcal{V}$ is called adjacent to a vertex $v \in \mathcal{V}$, denoted by $v \sim w$, if a suitable edge $e \in \mathcal{E}$ exists, so that $w$ can be reached from $v$ via this edge $e$. In the following we assume that a graph has no loops, which are edges that connect a vertex $v \in \mathcal{V}$ to itself, i.e. $v \sim v$, and no multi-edges, which are several equal edges between two vertices, i.e. $e_1, e_2 \in \mathcal{E}$ and $e_1 = e_2$. \\
A graph $\Gamma = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ with $\mathcal{V} = \{v_i\}_{i = 1, \ldots, V}$ is fully specified by its $V \times V$ adjacency matrix $A^{\Gamma}$. The entries of the adjacency matrix are given by
\begin{equation}
    \label{adjacency matrix}
    A^{\Gamma}_{i, j} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } v_i \sim v_j \\ 0 & \text{otherwise. } \end{cases}
\end{equation}
One sees immediately that the adjacency matrix of an non-directed graph is symmetric, since a vertex $v \in \mathcal{V}$ is adjacent to another vertex $w \in \mathcal{V}$ exactly when vice versa is also true, i.e. $v \sim w \Leftrightarrow w \sim v$. \\
The degree $d_{v_i}$ of a vertex $v_i \in \mathcal{V}$ is the number of edges that are connected to the vertex $v_i$, i.e. $d_{v_i} = \sum_{v_j \in \mathcal{V}} A_{i, j}$. For a directed graph the number of incoming bonds at a vertex $v_i$ is called incoming degree of $v_i$, denoted by $d^{\operatorname{t}}_{v_i}$, and the number of outgoing bonds at a vertex $v_i$ is called outgoing degree of $v_i$, denoted by $d^{\operatorname{o}}_{v_i}$. Clearly, $d^{\operatorname{t}}_{v_i} + d^{\operatorname{o}}_{v_i} = d_{v_i}$ holds. All degrees are assumed to be finite and positive, we hence exclude vertices with no edges coming in or going out. We denote by $D^{\Gamma}$ the degree matrix of a graph $\Gamma = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$, which is a diagonal $V \times V$ matrix with the entries
\begin{equation}
    \label{degree matrix}
    D^{\Gamma}_{i, j} = d_{v_i} \, \delta_{v_j, v_i}
\end{equation}
where $\delta_{v_j, v_i}$ is the Kronecker delta. \\
A vertex is incident to an edge, denoted by $v \in e$, if the vertex $v \in \mathcal{V}$ is one of the two vertices the edge $e \in \mathcal{E}$ connects. We define for an non-directed graph $\Gamma = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ with $\mathcal{V} = \{v_i\}_{i = 1, \ldots, V}$ and $\mathcal{E} = \{e_i\}_{i = 1, \ldots, E}$ the incidence matrix $I^{\Gamma} \in \mathbb{R}^{V \times E}$ by  
\begin{equation}
    \label{incidence matrix non-directed}
    I^{\Gamma}_{i, j}= \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } v_i \in e_j \\ 0 & \text{otherwise.} \end{cases}
\end{equation}
For a directed graph $\Gamma = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ with $\mathcal{V} = \{v_i\}_{i = 1, \ldots, V}$ and $\mathcal{E} = \mathcal{B} = \{b_i\}_{i = 1, \ldots, B}$ we define the $V \times B$ incidence matrix $I^{\Gamma}$ by 
\begin{equation}
    \label{incidence matrix directed}
    I^{\Gamma}_{i, j}= \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } b_j = (v_i, \cdot) \\ -1 & \text{if } b_j = (\cdot, v_i) \\ 0 & \text{if } v_i \notin b_j. \end{cases}
\end{equation}
We further denote by $\mathcal{E}_v$ the set of all edges incident to the vertex $v$ (i.e. containing $v$). \\

So far we have considered graphs as discrete combinatorial objects. From now on we consider graphs as $1$-dimensional networks and the edges will be treated as $1$-dimensional segments. For this purpose a natural projection exists $\pi \colon \widetilde{\Gamma} \to \Gamma$ that maps two points $x_b$ and $x_{\overline{b}}$ of two reversal bonds $b$ and $\overline{b}$ connecting the vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$ to a point $x_e$ on a non-directed edge $e$ connecting the same vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$ as shown in \cref{fig3}.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \end{center}
    \caption{Projection $\pi \colon \widetilde{\Gamma} \to \Gamma$ illustrated on a single edge.}
    \label{fig3}
\end{figure}

Roughly speaking, we now imagine the edges $\mathcal{E}$ of a graph $\Gamma = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ not as abstract relations between the vertices $\mathcal{V}$, but rather as physical “wires” connecting them. For that we add a structure that equips $\Gamma$ with a topology and metric:

\begin{definition}[{\cite[Definition~1.3.1.]{BerkolaikoKuchment:2013}}]
    \label{metric graph}
    A graph $\Gamma = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ is said to be a metric graph, if 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item each bond $b$ is assigned a positive length $\ell_b \in (0, \infty)$;
        \item the lengths of the bonds that are reversals of each other are assumed to be equal, i.e. $\ell_b = \ell_{\overline{b}}$, and thus the length $\ell_e$ of an edge $e$ is also defined (by the projection $\pi$, see \cref{fig3});
        \item a coordinate $x_b \in [0, \ell_b]$ increasing in the direction of the bond is assigned on each bond $b$;
        \item the relation $x_{\overline{b}} = \ell_b − x_b$ holds between the coordinates on mutually reversed bonds (in other words, $x_{\overline{b}}$ and $x_b$ are mapped to the same point on $e$ by the projection $\pi$, see \cref{fig3}).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Here, $x_b$ or $x_e$ are local coordinates associated with the bond $b$ or the non-directed edge $e$. In most cases, when this does not lead to any confusion, we drop the subscript of the coordinate $x_b$ and denote it just by $x$. From \cref{metric graph} and \cref{fig3} it is clear that a metric graph can be both directed and undirected. Of course, in the case of a non-directed edge $e = (v, w)$, one must then determine at which of the two vertices $x_e = 0$ and at which $x_e = \ell_e$ holds. \\
For some considerations it makes sense that the lengths of all edges are equal, which justifies the following notion:

\begin{definition}[{\cite[Definition~1.3.2.]{BerkolaikoKuchment:2013}}]
    \label{metric graph equilateral}
    A metric graph $\Gamma$ is said to be equilateral, if the lengths of all its bonds (equivalently, edges) are equal: $\ell_b \equiv \ell$.
\end{definition}

The introduction of a length $\ell_e$ for each edge $e$ of a graph $\Gamma$ enables us to interpret the graph $\Gamma$ as a topological space, which is the union of all edges whose ends are identified with the same vertex. We note that in the following the graphs are not assumed to be embedded into an Euclidean space or a Riemannian manifold in any way. A graph with a finite number of vertices and edges, whose edges all have finite lengths will be called compact and it is also compact as a topological space. \\
Any metric graph $\Gamma = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ can be equipped with a natural metric. If a sequence of edges $\{ e_i \}_{i = 1, \ldots, n} \subset \mathcal{E}$ forms a path, the length of the path is defined as $\sum^{n}_{i=1} \ell_i < \infty$. For two vertices $v, w \in \mathcal{V}$, the distance $\mathrm{dist}(v,w)$ is defined as the minimal length over all path connecting them. One should notice that the points of a metric graph $\Gamma$ are not only its vertices, but all intermediate points $x_e \in e$ on the edges $e \in \mathcal{E}$ as well. Since along each edge $e$ the distance is determined by the coordinate $x_e$, it is easy to define the distance $\mathrm{dist}(x_{e_1},x_{e_2})$ between two points $x_{e_1} \in [0, \ell_{e_1}]$ and $x_{e_2} \in [0, \ell_{e_2}]$, $e_1, e_2 \in \mathcal{E}$, of the graph that are not necessarily vertices. \\
When we speak about functions $f \colon \Gamma \to \mathbb{R}$ on graphs, we consider them defined on all points of each edge and not only on the vertices. By introducing a metric or distance between two points of a metric graph $\Gamma$, we can define the space of continuous functions $C(\Gamma)$. The presence of the coordinate $x_e$ along the edges $e \in \mathcal{E}$ enables one to define in the natural way the Lebesgue measure on the graph. Having this measure, one can define $L_2(e)$, the space of measurable functions $f \colon e \to \mathbb{R}$ for which its absolute value is Lebesgue square integrable, i.e.
\begin{equation*}
    \lVert f \rVert^{2}_{L_2(e)} \coloneqq \int_e \lvert f(x) \rvert^2 \, \textup{d} x < \infty.
\end{equation*}
The space $L_2(\Gamma)$ on $\Gamma = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ is the orthogonal direct sum of spaces $L_2(e)$, i.e. $L_2(\Gamma) = \bigotimes_{e \in \mathcal{E}} L_2(e)$, and its norm is defined via
\begin{equation*} 
    \lVert f \rVert^{2}_{L_2(\Gamma)} \coloneqq \sum_{e \in \mathcal{E}} \lVert f \rVert^{2}_{L_2(e)} < \infty.
\end{equation*} 
Of course, both $L_2(e)$ and $L_2(\Gamma)$ are Hilbert spaces. Consequently, the Sobolev space $H^1 (e)$ consist of all functions on $e$ that have all their distributional derivatives up to the order 1 belong to $L_2(e)$. Its norm is defined via
\begin{equation*}
    \lVert f \rVert^{2}_{H^1(e)} \coloneqq \int_e \lvert f(x) \rvert^2 + \lvert f^{\prime}(x) \rvert^2 \, dx < \infty.
\end{equation*}
The Sobolev space $H^1 (\Gamma)$ consists of all continuous functions on $\Gamma$ that belong to $H^1 (e)$ for each edge $e$ and such that 
\begin{equation*} 
    \lVert f \rVert^{2}_{H^1 (\Gamma)} \coloneqq \sum_{e \in \mathcal{E}} \lVert f \rVert^{2}_{H^1 (e)} < \infty.
\end{equation*}
This means that the space $H^1 (\Gamma)$ can be defined as $H^1 (\Gamma) =  \bigotimes_{e \in \mathcal{E}} H^1 (e) \cap C^{0}(\Gamma)$.\\
The continuity condition imposed on functions from the Sobolev space $H^1 (\Gamma)$ means that any function $f$ from this space assumes the same value at a vertex $v \in \mathcal{V}$ on all edges adjacent to this vertex $v$, and thus $f(v)$ is uniquely defined. This is a natural condition for $1$-dimensional $H^1$-functions, which are known to be continuous in the standard $1$-dimensional setting. \\

In the following we introduce differential operators on metric graphs, by which we mean that we consider a differential operator $\mathcal{H} \left[ \cdot \right]$ on each edge $e \in \mathcal{E}$ of a metric graph $\Gamma = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$, which will be called Hamiltonian. An example of this would be the $1$-dimensional Schrödinger operator
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{H} \left[ f \right](x) = -\frac{\textup{d}^2 f}{\textup{d} x^2}(x) + V(x)f(x)
\end{equation*}
with a potential function $V$. One can formulate the differential equation for each edge $e \in \mathcal{E}$ of the form
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{H} \left[ f |_e \right] (x_e) = g|_e(x_e), \quad \text{for all  } x_e \in (0, \ell_e),
\end{equation*}
where the functions $g|_e \colon (0, \ell_e) \to \mathbb{R}$ are given source terms. We note that for this operator the direction of the edge is irrelevant. This is not the case if one wants to include first order derivative terms. Then we need to assume the graph to be directed and consider bonds $b \in \mathcal{B}$ and the corresponding coordinates. \\
The classical case of differential operators on an interval, which we can understand as a graph with one edge and two vertices, makes clear that the definition of a differential operator on a metric graph is not complete until its domain is described. The domain description should involve continuity conditions along the edges and some appropriate boundary value conditions at the vertices, which we call vertex conditions and are an analogue of boundary conditions for a single interval. The addition of these conditions justifies the introduction of the following notion:

\begin{definition}[{\cite[Definition~1.4.1.]{BerkolaikoKuchment:2013}}]\label{quantum graph} \ \\
    Quantum graph is a metric graph $\Gamma$ equipped with a differential operator $\mathcal{H} \left[ \cdot \right]$ (Hamiltonian), accompanied by “appropriate” vertex conditions $\mathcal{V}$. That is, a quantum graph $\Gamma$ is a triple
    \begin{equation*}
        (\Gamma, \; \mathcal{H} \left[ \cdot \right], \; \mathcal{V}).
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}

We introduce the most well-known vertex conditions, which are called Kirchhoff-Neumann conditions and require: 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:Kirchhoff-Neumann_general}
    \begin{cases} 
        f(x) \text{ is continuous on } \Gamma \\ \text{and} \\  \text{at each vertex } v \in \mathcal{V} \text{ one has } \sum_{e \in \mathcal{E}_v} \frac{\textup{d} f}{\textup{d} x_e}(v) = 0.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
The derivatives are assumed to be taken in the directions away from the vertex, which we will call the outgoing directions. The first condition of \cref{eq:Kirchhoff-Neumann_general} is called the continuity condition while the second is sometimes termed as the current conservation condition.
