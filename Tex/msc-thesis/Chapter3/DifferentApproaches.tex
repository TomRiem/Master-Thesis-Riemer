\chapter{Different Approaches for Solving the Drift-Diffusion Equation on Metric Graphs using PINNs}

In this chapter we present different approaches of using PINNs to solve a set of drift-diffusion equations on a given metric graph to given initial and boundary conditions. In \cref{ch3:sec1} we discuss an approach where the set drift-diffusion equations is considered on all edges simultaneously in the residual network, so we merge all edges and consider the problem globally. In section \cref{ch3:sec2} we discuss an approach where we consider one drift-diffusion equation on each edge individually in a residual network and we thus obtain as many cost functions as edges, which we optimise one after the other in the learning phase. Furthermore, we will use different types and topologies of neural networks for these two approaches. We will perform numerical experiments for each combination of PINN approach and neural network and compare the solutions with those generated by the FEM presented in \cref{ch2}. We are particularly interested in the accuracy and efficiency of the different approaches so that we can determine a superior method for solving the differential equation. Finally, in \cref{ch3:sec3}, we will compare the performance of a PINN with explicitly calculated derivatives used inside the Hamiltonian, and thus in the residual network, with that of a PINN that uses automatic differentiation for this purpose, in order to demonstrate the capabilities of \lstinline!TensorFlow!. \\
For all experiments, we consider the graph given by the following adjacency matrix: 
The numerical experiments are implemented in the toolbox \lstinline!Manopt.jl!. They were run on a Lenovo ThinkPad L490, 64 bit Windows system, 1.8 Ghz Intel Core i7-8565U, 32 GB RAM, with Julia 1.5.2.
