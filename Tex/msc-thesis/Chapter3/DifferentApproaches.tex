\chapter{The Performance of a Physics Informed Neural Networks approach for solving the set of Drift-Diffusion Equations on a Metric Graph}
\label{ch3}

In this chapter we present a $PINN$ approach for solving the set of drift-diffusion equations defined on a given metric graph as described in \cref{ch1:sec2}. \\
In \cref{ch3:sec1} we construct the cost function for this approach, in which the approximation problem on all edges are considered simultaneously in the learning phase. This means that for all edges we combine the deviation of the approximate solution, which is given by the corresponding neural network, to the drift-diffusion equation and the deviation of the approximate solution to the initial and vertex conditions in one single cost function and focus only on solving it in the learning phase. Furthermore, we perform numerical experiments in this section, in which we use different types of neural networks in this $PINN$ approach. These numerical experiments were implemented with \lstinline!Python 3.8.8!. Thereby, we compare the deviation of the outputs produced by the corresponding neural network from those produced by the $FVM$ method presented in \cref{ch2} on the same grid points in order to determine the superior type of neural network. \\
In \cref{ch3:sec3} we present methods for the explicit computation of the first and second order derivatives with respect to the input of the different types of neural networks presented in \cref{ch3:sec1}.  We perform numerical tests to see whether it is reasonable to use these instead of automatic differentiation when the approach presented in \cref{ch3:sec1} is implemented with \lstinline!Python 3.8.8!.
